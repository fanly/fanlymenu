# Vite Electron builder template

Vite+Electron = ðŸ”¥

This template uses [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/) as bundler and [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/) as compiler.

This is a minimalist template created mainly for my personal needs.

## Features:
- Type checking in `.ts` and `.vue` files. Using [VueDX](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience/tree/master/packages/typecheck)
- Automatic draft release on new commit in the main branch. Using [Electron Builder Action](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/action-electron-builder)
